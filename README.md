<h1 align="center">Summon</h1>

<p align="center"><b>An agent harness you can scale.</b> A coding agent with a built-in specialised-sub-agent delegation harness and a premium neon TUI — one command: <code>summon</code>.</p>

<p align="center"><i>Summon agents. Give them goals. Watch the work fan out.</i></p>

---

Summon is a coding agent that can **decompose a goal, write metaprompts, and fan the work out to
specialised, tool-restricted, model-tiered sub-agents in parallel** — with output-contract validation,
deterministic verification, a window-budget governor, safety guards, a live multi-agent dashboard,
named team recipes, and an optional warm worker pool. It looks like Summon out of the box: a sub-zero
gradient `SUMMON` wordmark, rounded box tool-cards, bordered messages, breathing gradient spinner.

> **Cost model:** Summon drives sub-agents through your existing Claude subscription via OAuth. Every
> spawn ejects `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and fails closed unless it is routing through your Claude
> subscription, so a worker can never silently fall back to pay-per-token billing. Bring your own
> authenticated login; Summon adds no separate API key.

## Install

Requires **Node ≥ 22** and **npm ≥ 10**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jordan-baillie/aurora.git summon
cd summon
npm run setup            # install + build + put `summon` on your PATH
```

`npm run setup` is the one-command path on every OS. Prefer a script? Run `./install.sh`
(macOS/Linux/Git-Bash) or `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1` (Windows).

Then start it and connect your Claude subscription:

```bash
summon                   # start the TUI
# then, inside Summon, run once:
/login                   # authenticate via OAuth (uses your Claude subscription)
```

That's it — `/login` is a slash-command **inside** the running app, not a shell command. Config lives in
`~/.summon/`. Your normal tooling is untouched.

> **`summon` not found after setup?** Your npm global bin directory isn't on your PATH. Run
> `npm prefix -g`, add that directory to your PATH, and reopen your terminal. (`npm run setup` prints a
> warning if this happens.)

> **Windows:** Summon's deterministic `verify` step and the `bash` tool use Git Bash. Install
> [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) so `bash` is on your PATH.

The build is **hermetic and reproducible** — the model catalog (`packages/ai/src/*.generated.ts`) is
committed, so `npm run build` needs no network. Maintainers refresh it with `npm run refresh-models`.

## What you get

- **The agent** — `summon`: read / bash / edit / write tools, sessions, a polished interactive TUI.
- **The harness, built in** (zero setup): the `spawn_agent` tool family is auto-loaded —
  - `spawn_agent({ agent, prompt })` — delegate one task to a specialist.
  - `spawn_agents({ tasks: [...] })` — parallel fan-out (adaptive warm-pool for big batches).
  - `run_team({ team, vars })` — named recipes: sequential stages, parallel steps.
  - `run_blueprint({ blueprint, vars })` — a **code-defined DAG**: deterministic shell *code nodes*
    interleaved with scoped *agent nodes*, run with continuous wide parallelism and fail-closed
    dependent skipping (the LLM only runs inside the contained agent nodes).
  - a live multi-agent **TUI dashboard** (`/harness-drill`, `/harness-web`).
- **The Summon look** — the `summon` theme is the default; switch anytime with `summon themes <name>`.

## Specialists (built-in registry)

| agent | tier | tools | output contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scout` | fast | read · grep · find · ls | `## findings` + `## confidence` |
| `builder` | standard | read · edit · write · bash · grep · find · ls | `## change-summary` + `## verification` |
| `reviewer` | fast | read · grep · find · ls · bash | `## verdict` + `## claims` + `## could-not-verify` |
| `orchestrator` | frontier | read · grep · find · ls + spawn tools | `## delegated` + `## synthesis` |

A **load-time, fail-closed validator** rejects unsafe shapes (an orchestrator with write/bash; a
worker with any delegation tool; a write-capable bundle scoped into a protected path). Workers are
spawned with a strict `--tools` allowlist, so sub-agents never get delegation tools.

**Add a specialist** = drop an `agent.json` + `SKILL.md` in
`packages/coding-agent/src/builtin/harness/agents/<name>/`, or per-project in `<project>/.summon/agents/`.
Teams live alongside in `…/harness/teams/` or `<project>/.summon/teams/`.

## Safety (trustable headless)
- **Deterministic verify** — `spawn_agent({ verify: "<cmd>" })`; the harness runs the acceptance
  command itself and a failure overrides the agent's own claim.
- **$0-OAuth canary** — every spawn ejects `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and fails closed before exec unless it
  is routing through your Claude subscription, so a worker can never silently bill pay-per-token.
- **Cross-platform spawn** — sub-agents launch via the running Node runtime (PATH-independent), so the
  harness works identically on Windows and POSIX.
- **Window-aware governor** — caps concurrent weight and tracks consumption against the Claude-Max
  rolling 5h window; `HARNESS_WINDOW_TOKENS` opts into a hard window gate.
- **Tool-layer guard** — every write/exec-capable worker blocks destructive bash and writes outside
  the project root / into protected paths (separator-agnostic, correct on Windows and POSIX).
- **Within-run result cache + dedup** — identical read-only sub-tasks collapse to one execution.
  Disable with `HARNESS_NO_CACHE=1`.
- **builder→reviewer auto-pairing** — `spawn_agent({ review: true })` runs the reviewer over the git
  diff and fails closed unless it APPROVEs.
- **Fleet observability** — a cross-run spawn ledger (cost-per-agent-hour, done/cache-hit rates,
  rendered to `~/.summon/harness/fleet-summary.md`) plus a boot prompt audit that flags skill-bloat.

## Configuration (all optional)
`SUMMON_CODING_AGENT_DIR` (config home, default `~/.summon`), `SUMMON_MODEL` / `SUMMON_BIN`,
`HARNESS_AGENTS_DIR` / `HARNESS_TEAMS_DIR` / `HARNESS_BLUEPRINTS_DIR`, `HARNESS_POOL_SIZE`,
`HARNESS_PREWARM` (comma-sep bundles to stand up hot at startup), `HARNESS_WINDOW_TOKENS` (>0 turns on
a hard rolling-window gate). The harness model tiers default to Claude Opus / Sonnet / Haiku.
